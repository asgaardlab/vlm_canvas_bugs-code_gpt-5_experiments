```
    export class Application {

        private readonly state: GameState;
        private readonly renderer: Renderer;
        private readonly ticker: PIXI.Ticker;

        private constructor(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement, resources: Record<string, any>) {
            this.app = new PIXI.Application({
                width: CANVAS_WIDTH,
                height: CANVAS_HEIGHT,
                backgroundAlpha: 0,
                antialias: true,
                view: canvas
            });
            //@ts-ignore
+            window.__PIXI_APP__ = this.app;
